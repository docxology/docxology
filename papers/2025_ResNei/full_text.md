Solution Design Document 
ResNei — Research Neighbourhood – is an AI-augmented environment designed to 
transform how we discover, analyse, and connect ideas. 
At its core is the Research Discovery Engine, which constructs a living, responsive 
knowledge graph through the distillation of verified concepts and the dynamic linking of 
an evolving corpus of scientific knowledge. This graph is structured as a set of Conceptual 
Nexus Models (CNMs)—modular representations of connected ideas, designed to surface 
signals to support impactful inquiry and collaboration. 
Our UX design moves away from conventional passive, attention-driven systems toward a 
dynamic, action-intention model that centres collaboration, responsiveness, and 
contextual insight. A world where research becomes not just efficient, but responsive, 
intuitive, and interconnected. 
This platform aims to scale research processes through the interplay of generalists and 
specialists. Our platform involves a graphical concept model, enabling specialists to engage 
with reliable evaluation of scientific output, while democratising the otherwise intractable 
web of knowledge for the generalist. The co-evolution of expert-lead early adoption with 
generalist participation drives insight and growth: where research thrives through their 
collaboration. Grounded in scientific protocols and social accountability, ResNei values 
reciprocity, interdependence, and access. Innovation here acknowledges its real-world 
costs—social, ecological, and temporal—and builds not just tools, but shared capacity for 
meaningful discovery. 
Project Status: As of the first version of this publication in May 2025, this Solution Design 
Document outlines the foundational concepts, architecture, and guiding principles of 
ResNei. The project is currently in early development, with a set of working prototypes and 
a technical paper in preprint. This document supports the transition from conceptual 
design to implementation.

Introduction 
Research Neighbourhood is a platform designed to support research discovery and 
collaboration. A companion paper describes several technical and backend elements of the 
system (Vladimir Baulin et al. 2025, forthcoming), while this paper focuses on the design 
and responsive aspects. Rather than maximising passive engagement, the platform is built 
around action-intention design, where the system actively infers user intentions based on 
their actions, adapting in real-time to foster meaningful interaction. By leveraging various 
Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. techniques and 
computational methods for synthesising language, scientific research, and domain 
knowledge, the platform provides analyses and visualisations that help users navigate 
complex research topics more efficiently. 
The platform invites researchers, data analysts, educators, students, and anyone curious 
about how knowledge connects and evolves. Drawing on established research 
methods—such as following conceptual lineages, mapping references, and synthesising 
diverse viewpoints—it helps users explore relationships across ideas, fields, and formats. As 
Google Scholar opened access to academic content, this platform opens access to the 
process of research: discovering connections, recognising patterns, and finding resonance 
between seemingly distant topics (Ronen Tamari and Daniel Friedman 2023). 
Interpersonalised experiences are central to the design, supporting shared annotation, 
discussion, and collaborative interpretation. Rather than treating research as a solitary or 
static activity, the platform presents it as an open-ended, interconnected exploration that 
values participation, context, and the potential for unexpected associations. 
Resnei will gather the research data and literature base through open access sources and 
uploads provided by users. This is further supported by the paper compositor that will 
assist researchers by generating structured drafts from users input: topic, abstract, and 
optional data. The system meanwhile identifies research context, restructures research 
content, and identifies new research directions. This ensures efficient exploration and 
composition, reducing manual effort while enhancing research development. 
Knowledge graphs are the primary interactive elements that users will explore to draw out 
relational concepts from within and among research fields. These networked visualisations 
provide the contextual landscape in which users explore, develop, and, most importantly, 
collaborate on ideas. By visualising these connections, users can gain new insights and 
engage in collaborative research across various disciplines. 
By integrating multimodal interaction methods—such as text, speech, touch, and graphical 
inputs—Research Neighbourhood enables users to navigate complex information 
landscapes. They engage with these landscapes through research data, e.g. PDFs, LaTeX 
documents, and plain text files. The platform efficiently handles these formats, allowing 
users to upload, process, and analyse data in diverse ways, affording a rich, engaging and 
collaborative research experience.

Guided by a cognitive load management, the Research Neighbourhood eliminates visual 
clutter to maintain consistency, necessity and meaning. The interface is intuitive and 
consistent, ensuring users can engage with the platform without unnecessary distractions. 
Ultimately, the platform aims to mediate the research process while enabling collaboration 
and collective idea development through its action-intention, interpersonal design.

Background: Conceptual and Design Foundations 
The development of Research Neighbourhood is rooted in the need for coordinated 
research management and collaborative exploration within the academic and scientific 
communities. In a rapidly evolving research landscape, traditional document management 
systems often fall short in facilitating flexible, intuitive, and collaborative workflows. 
Why Research Neighbourhood? 
Unlike traditional research management tools that primarily focus on storing, modifying, 
and referencing documents, Research Neighbourhood reimagines how researchers 
interact with their collections: 
●​ Dynamic Connections: Documents, concepts, and people are not isolated entities 
but interconnected within a broader knowledge network. 
●​ Enhanced Comprehension: Summarisation and visualisation tools provide new 
insights and foster a deeper understanding of content relationships. 
●​ Collaborative Exploration: Groups come together to explore research topics, with 
interaction going beyond writing papers and leaving comments. These different 
kinds of groups can grow and dissolve as the research landscape evolves, offering a 
dynamic space for cross-disciplinary collaboration and providing opportunities to 
connect with related work. This can look like participation in discussion and 
annotation on collaborative works. 
By offering a visually rich, collaborative, and cognitively supportive environment, 
Research Neighbourhood aims to bridge the gap between data organisation and 
meaningful research interactions. 
Motivation 
 
Researchers, students, and collaborative teams often face challenges related to: 
8

![page8_img1.png](images/page8_img1.png)

## Page 9

●​ Document Overload: Managing vast collections of research papers, notes, and 
supplementary files. 
●​ Lack of Interoperability: Incompatibility between file formats, particularly when 
working with LaTeX or annotated PDFs. 
●​ Collaborative Barriers: Difficulty in sharing insights, annotations, and context when 
working with dispersed teams. 
●​ Inefficient Knowledge Organisation: Struggling to establish connections between 
related works and ideas. 
Research Neighbourhood is designed to address these challenges through a research 
environment where documents are not just stored but actively analysed, cross-referenced, 
and collaboratively enhanced.

Design Principles 
 
The conceptual foundation and design principles of Research Neighbourhood draws on 
theories and practices from several domains: 
1.​ Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) 
Research Neighbourhood follows HCI principles through intuitive and efficient user 
interactions. Progressive disclosure is employed across multiple scales and directions of 
exploration—longitudinal, latitudinal, and relational—enabling users to navigate 
information both non-linearly and sequentially. Affordances (opportunities for action) and 
signifiers (meaningful environmental markers) make possible interactions clear, enabling 
effective navigation through tasks and features. 
2.​ Information Visualisation 
The platform leverages advanced information visualisation techniques to make complex 
research landscapes more accessible and interpretable. Semantic zooming enables users to 
explore clusters of related papers and concepts at varying levels of detail. 
Knowledge Graph representations are used to map relationships between research 
artefacts—such as papers, concepts, or methods—within an evolving research space. While 
edges may remain implicit (unlabelled), the structure captures the proximity and 
association of ideas, supporting intuitive exploration rather than strict logical sequencing. 
Drawing from knowledge graph theory, the system enables relational navigation that 
mirrors the organic, interconnected nature of research fields. Visual pathfinding principles 
ensure that even dense, layered data remains readable, actionable, and navigable at 
different scales. 
3.​ Neuro Informed Design 
Research Neighbourhood applies Neuro Informed Design principles to reduce cognitive 
load while maintaining coherence and contextual awareness (see Appendix). Instead of 
segmented presentation, i.e., fragmenting tasks into small, isolated parts, the platform 
organises information into contextual groups that make sense as cohesive units. 
10

![page10_img1.png](images/page10_img1.png)

## Page 11

To support intuitive interaction, contextual cues and dynamic visual hierarchy are used to 
subtly guide users without causing distraction. Fault tolerance mechanisms further reduce 
anxiety by enabling easy undo/redo actions and providing clear warnings before 
irreversible tasks. Inspired by neuroarchitecture, the design prioritises smooth interaction 
flow and visual consistency to minimise cognitive friction and maintain user focus. 
4.​ Collaborative Knowledge Building 
Research Neighbourhood affords collaborative knowledge building through social 
annotation and collective intelligence practices. By enabling users to discuss, annotate, and 
interpret knowledge graphs and texts together, the platform supports shared 
understanding and sensemaking. Collaboration features are designed to encourage active 
participation while maintaining data integrity. 
This commitment to shared research infrastructure resonates with principles emerging in 
the decentralised science (DeSci) movement, which promotes accountable, 
community-governed approaches to knowledge production and stewardship (Daniel 
Friedman et al. 2022). Here, transparency means not just that materials are technically 
accessible (e.g., not behind paywalls), but that they are legible, navigable, and 
usable—designed to support meaningful access rather than procedural compliance. At the 
same time, Research Neighbourhood emphasizes a distributed model—where participation, 
responsibility, and insight are shared across a network of diverse contributors, rather than 
enforced through technical decentralisation alone.

Design and User Experience Considerations 
The system’s design philosophy acknowledges the need for balance between structure and 
flexibility, by centring the following considerations: 
●​ Mediated Workflows: Interface elements are positioned to mediate research 
workflows, weaving together diverging, complementary, and opposing ideas. 
●​ Contextual Awareness: Understanding that users may switch between rapid 
skimming and in-depth analysis, with the interface adapting to both modes 
seamlessly. 
●​ Adaptability: Instead of rigid individual customisation, the platform prioritises 
customisable layouts and shared workspaces that mediate collaboration between 
researchers. 
●​ Interpersonal Design: Tools and features are designed to promote discussion, 
shared annotation, and collective meaning-making, strengthening research as a 
collaborative rather than purely individual pursuit.

Values 
Our work is grounded in a commitment to reciprocity, relationship, interdependence, and 
access. These values guide us in building a system that supports an open information and 
knowledge commons, where context is preserved, and connections are made visible and 
meaningful. 
We believe in collaboration over competition, favouring modularity, composability, 
cooperation, and collaboration across people, teams, and ideas. This affords flexible, 
synergistic contributions that maintain integrity and shared growth. 
Our technical and ethical approach follows the FAIR data principles—ensuring all 
knowledge is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. These principles ensure 
that knowledge remains shareable, extensible, and usable by a diverse and evolving 
community. 
We are committed to transparency—but not as a checkbox. Here, transparency means 
visible and not merely technically accessible (e.g., not behind paywalls). Materials are legible, 
navigable, and usable—designed to support meaningful access, not just procedural 
compliance. 
We use a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) to promote open innovation while 
protecting contributors. This license ensures proper attribution, restricts commercial use 
without involving original authors, and requires any derivative works to remain equally 
open and shareable. 
This research-informed platform brings together research specialists and generalists, as 
well as fields that weave across the yawning gap within and between the two, for instance, 
trans- and interdisciplinary fields. Validation of the core engine will call on domain 
expertise, while generalists are invited to strengthen and discover connections among 
ontologies. The foundation and potential scale of our technology, in other words, rests on 
the mutual reinforcement between the dense nodes of specialist knowledge and the 
expansive mycelial reach of generalist understandings and experience. We recognise that 
technology scales most effectively when it builds on proven processes, rather than 
bypassing them. 
While professional researchers may serve as early adopters and stewards of rigour, it is 
through the active participation of generalist users that enables the system to grow, adapt, 
and evolve. Importantly, the relationship between generalists and specialists is not 
oppositional but interdependent. The platform is designed to support pathways of 
learning, contribution, and skill-building that allow generalist users to grow into 
domain-specific expertise over time. This reflects our development ethos: from 
proof-of-concept, to minimum viable product, to a co-evolving system shaped by its users 
and communities. 
13

## Page 14

We recognise that innovation may begin in curiosity or dedication, but it is never isolated. 
Every breakthrough draws on collective knowledge, shared infrastructures, and 
often-unseen forms of labour and care. Technological development consumes planetary 
resources and social labour, often unseen and unacknowledged. We honour the relational 
costs of innovation—whether that’s time away from caregiving, local commitments, or the 
shared infrastructures that sustain life. 
Anchored in values of reciprocity, relationship, interdependence, and access, the system 
supports a living knowledge commons, where context and connection are made visible, 
accountable, and meaningful. 
Together, these values shape not just what we build, but how we build—with transparency, 
care, and community. 
Ethical Consideration 
Multiple aspects of ethical consideration are relevant to the ResNei system, as it relates to 
human sociotechnical systems such as education, research, communication, and 
development. For example, use of AI generated images and text can reflect inherent 
discrimination and assumptions developed through training data and encoded in 
algorithms. Such systems, without deliberate design and ongoing diagnostics, could 
recapitulate or exacerbate a variety of discriminatory systemic mechanisms. 
It’s been well established that the research corpus itself—papers, datasets, historical 
records—is not neutral. It reflects long standing gender, racial, economic, geographic, 
linguistic, and disciplinary biases embedded in how knowledge has been produced, 
prioritised, and disseminated. Knowledge graphs and discovery engines also do not emerge 
in neutral spaces. Care is taken to design for epistemic plurality, ensuring that diverse 
contributions, histories, and perspectives can surface and be made visible within the 
research landscape. 
This extends into the way people do science. The doing of science is always in context: 
political, social, economic, and environmental. Traditional science makes assumptions 
about objectivity and neutrality, this distancing from context skews the scientist’s 
perspective, eliminating relational and interdependent affordances. Robin Wall Kimmerer 
identifies the limitations of Western science and its preferred objective view, and how it 
misses opportunities afforded by ways of knowing and being that are in relationship: 
“We are all the product of our worldviews—even scientists who claim pure objectivity. 
Their predictions for sweetgrass were consistent with their Western science worldview, 
which sets human beings outside of "nature" and judges their interactions with other 
species as largely negative. They had been schooled that the best way to protect a 
dwindling species was to leave it alone and keep people away. But the grassy meadows 
14

tell us that for sweetgrass, human beings are part of the system, a vital part.“ (Robin Wall 
Kimmerer, 2014) 
The production of scientific knowledge is often shaped by its funding. Research outcomes 
can be influenced—intentionally or otherwise—by the interests of institutions, 
governments, or private entities providing financial support. This influence can extend to 
the framing of questions, design of experiments, and interpretation of results. Within 
ResNei, efforts will be made to highlight the provenance of research, including funding 
disclosures when available, to help users critically evaluate the motivations and potential 
biases embedded in the sources. Awareness of funding dynamics is essential for building a 
knowledge system that supports critical engagement rather than uncritical acceptance of 
published claims.

Potential Harms and Risks 
Harm 
Risk 
Amelioration 
1. Exclusion through 
Design Bias 
Designs that prioritise 
dominant modes of 
interaction or assume 
universal accessibility risk 
reinforcing structural 
exclusion. Users who lack 
access to high-end devices, 
stable internet, or mainstream 
literacy/tech fluency may be 
sidelined, especially when 
systems reflect the needs of 
already-included groups. 
Without deliberate 
recognition, these exclusions 
may go unnoticed and become 
systemic. 
Instead of assuming universal 
accessibility, Research 
Neighbourhood takes an 
intentional approach to 
inclusion—actively identifying 
who may be excluded and 
prioritising those typically 
overlooked by mainstream design. 
2. Algorithmic 
Misrepresentation 
Poor summarisation, 
inaccurate clustering, or 
biased metadata extraction 
may distort the interpretation 
of research. 
All algorithmically generated 
outputs (e.g., summaries, clusters, 
scores) are presented alongside 
original content with clear 
indicators of confidence, example 
data points, and traceable 
provenance. Users can inspect 
source material, review the basis 
for outputs, and interactively 
adjust parameters to refine 
results—supporting informed and 
critical engagement. 
3. Overconfidence in 
AI Recommendations 
Users may defer to the AI's 
summaries or linkages 
without critical evaluation, 
amplifying misinformation or 
low-quality work. 
AI-generated outputs are framed 
as suggestions, not truths. 
Prompts encourage verification, 
and UI cues remind users that 
insights are provisional. 
Transparency and user feedback 
mechanisms support reflexive 
interpretation. 
4. Misplaced Trust in 
AI-Generated 
Knowledge Graphs 
Users may assume the 
knowledge graph represents 
an objective or complete map 
The knowledge graph is treated as 
a navigational aid, not a definitive 
map. Visual indicators, metadata 
18

## Page 19

of a research field, when it is 
shaped by data availability, 
algorithmic choices, and 
design framing. 
transparency, and user-driven 
overlays clarify the graph’s 
construction and scope. Users can 
trace connections, question 
assumptions, and contribute 
alternative perspectives. 
5. Reinforcement of 
existing inequalities 
in knowledge 
production and 
visibility. 
The system may look for more 
definitive outcomes, resulting 
in the exclusion of research 
work written by people who 
do not fit the mainstream 
research culture. 
Bias Alerts: Develop indicators or 
notices when content heavily 
skews toward certain geographies, 
fields, languages, perspectives, or 
demographics. 
6. Marginalisation of 
Less-Cited Research 
Ranking or clustering 
mechanisms might favour 
popular or mainstream 
papers, reinforcing 
disciplinary silos or 
overlooking new voices. 
Citation count is a tunable 
parameter, not a ranking default. 
The system supports alternative 
clustering logics—such as 
conceptual proximity, 
methodological similarity, or 
temporal relevance—allowing 
less-cited and emergent research 
to surface alongside mainstream 
work. 
7. Reduction of the 
diversity and 
pluralism necessary 
for robust scientific 
progress. 
Oversimplification of 
outcomes excludes voices that 
do not match traditional 
science writing formats and 
assumptions. Outcomes 
dependent on expectations 
become tools that prioritise 
content from certain 
geographies, fields, languages 
or demographics. 
Diverse Metrics: Allow clustering 
and relevance to be tuned by 
factors other than citation count, 
such as conceptual novelty, 
geographic diversity, author 
background, publication type, or 
thematic importance. 
6. Surveillance or 
Misuse of 
Collaborative 
Features 
Shared spaces and 
annotations could lead to 
concerns around IP theft, 
performance tracking, or 
misuse of peer contributions. 
Collaborative features are 
designed with privacy defaults, 
clear sharing boundaries, and 
user-controlled visibility. Open 
access is prioritised, and 
safeguards prevent unauthorised 
sharing of paywalled or private 
content in public spaces. 
19

## Page 20

7. Cognitive Overload 
from Complexity 
Highly interactive or layered 
visualisations may overwhelm 
some users, especially if 
adaptability isn't well 
balanced. 
The interface uses layered 
complexity with gradual reveal, 
contextual guidance, and optional 
simplifications. Users can adjust 
visual density and toggle features 
to match their preferred level of 
cognitive load. 
8. False Sense of 
Comprehensiveness 
Users might assume the 
system presents the full 
landscape of research when 
it's only showing what it has 
access to, or what's been 
algorithmically prioritised. 
The system communicates its 
scope and limitations through 
transparent messaging and visual 
cues, helping users recognise that 
the displayed research is partial 
and may exclude unseen, 
inaccessible, or out-of-scope 
content. 
9. Data Privacy 
Concerns 
Uploaded documents, 
annotations, and user 
interaction logs could be 
misused if not properly 
secured or anonymised. 
User-uploaded content and 
interactions are private by default. 
Prompts, such as "Are you the legal 
owner of this content?" help 
establish responsibility. Clear 
policies and interface disclosures 
reinforce boundaries and mitigate 
risk of misuse.

Action-Intention Model 
The Research Neighbourhood employs an Action-Intention Model, in which user actions 
are treated as meaningful signals of research direction and intent. Unlike traditional 
attention-based systems that focus on passive engagement or maximising content 
consumption, this model actively responds to the goals, actions, and intentions of users. 
 
The platform is designed to support user-defined research goals and collaborative 
practices, offering relevant tools and contextual structures as users explore materials or 
engage in shared discussions. In the current design, the system responds to explicit 
actions and interaction patterns, aligning with common research directions—such as 
familiarising with a concept, exploring related ideas, or comparing and evaluating findings. 
While the platform does not infer intent through predictive modelling in the current stage , 
its architecture allows for future development in this area, where adaptive responses could 
be refined through more nuanced understanding of user behaviour. 
This dynamic, real-time responsiveness ensures that the platform is not just a static 
repository of information but an active, responsive environment where collaboration and 
idea development can flourish. As users interact with the system—through actions such as 
annotating documents, linking concepts, or discussing findings—the platform responds by 
highlighting related resources, suggesting relevant connections, or offering new avenues 
for collaboration, all driven by the user's current intentions. 
By centring on user actions and intentions, the platform creates a more fluid and adaptive 
research experience, fostering an environment where collaboration is enhanced and 
research progresses through active, meaningful engagement.

## Page 22

Behaviour of the Action-Intention Model 
 
The action-intention model in Research Neighbourhood behaves as a responsive 
framework, structured around identifiable user actions that reflect underlying research 
goals. Instead of predicting user intent through automated inference, the system supports a 
situated and action-oriented interaction model. 
1. Goal-Oriented Interaction Pathways 
●​ Users engage with the platform by taking actions that signal direction — such as 
uploading a paper, opening a concept map, highlighting a passage, or initiating a 
discussion. 
●​ These actions are treated not as isolated commands but as part of a trajectory of 
inquiry, revealing the user’s research direction over time. 
2. Adaptive Interface Cues 
●​ The interface adapts contextually—not by guessing user needs, but by surfacing 
relevant tools or views appropriate to the activity at hand. For example: 
○​ When annotating, users can access linked references and related ideas in the 
side panel. 
○​ When viewing a network graph, users can toggle between conceptual 
groupings, shared nodes, or active discussions. 
3. Collaborative Structuring 
22

![page22_img1.png](images/page22_img1.png)

## Page 23

●​ The platform makes interpersonal interaction visible and actionable: 
○​ Edits and comments are attributed and threaded (for example using 
assertion- and pattern-based information architectures). 
○​ Users can track how a topic has evolved through group engagement. 
○​ Shared workspaces support layered perspectives without forcing consensus. 
4. Nonlinear Exploration Supported by Stable Anchors 
●​ Users are free to move non-linearly—navigating from a graph to a document to a 
group annotation—yet the system maintains consistent contextual anchors (such as 
current topic focus or discussion thread). 
●​ This supports deep exploration without disorientation. 
5. Minimal System Intervention, Maximum Research Coherence 
●​ The model avoids interruptive prompts or automated content reshuffling. 
●​ Instead, it provides a gently guided structure: offering clear ways to orient, relate, 
and act upon research material, while keeping user control intact.​

User Experience 
User Interaction Design 
The interaction design philosophy of Research Neighbourhood revolves around seamless 
and intuitive engagement, supporting diverse interaction methods while maintaining a 
cohesive user experience. The primary objective is to provide users with flexible, 
action-intention interactions that minimise cognitive load and maximise clarity. 
Core Interaction Modes 
1.​ Textual Interaction 
○​ Users can input text through traditional keyboard entry or text-based 
commands. 
○​ Autocomplete and contextual suggestions enhance efficiency and reduce effort. 
○​ Plain language processing allows for natural queries and conversational 
interaction. 
2.​ Voice Interaction 
○​ Utilises Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies to enable 
voice commands and audio feedback. 
○​ Acoustic models are fine-tuned for accurate recognition and natural 
pronunciation. 
○​ Voice interactions are optional and can be disabled or configured to suit the 
user’s environment. 
3.​ Touch and Gesture Interaction 
○​ Supports touch screens, styluses, and gesture recognition for VR and AR 
environments. 
○​ Pinch, swipe, and tap gestures facilitate navigation and data manipulation. 
○​ Haptic feedback is integrated where applicable to reinforce actions. 
4.​ Graphical and Visual Interaction 
○​ Users can upload and annotate research documents, diagrams, and images. 
○​ Drag-and-drop functionality enhances ease of use, especially during data 
organisation. 
○​ Interactive visualisations provide real-time feedback and insights. 
Interaction Principles 
26

## Page 27

●​ Action-Intention Design: The interface responds dynamically to user actions, 
inferring likely intentions and adjusting options based on context. Grounded in 
active inference and the perception-action model, this approach reduces cognitive 
overhead by offering situationally relevant pathways rather than static menus. It 
supports emergent workflows by anticipating user needs without requiring explicit 
input, enabling a more intuitive and adaptive interaction environment. 
●​ Minimal Visual Clutter: All unnecessary visual elements are omitted to maintain 
focus on content. 
●​ Feedback and Responsiveness: The system provides immediate visual or audio 
feedback to user actions. 
●​ Accessibility: Features include screen reader support, adjustable font sizes, and 
high-contrast themes.

Interface Design 
The interface design of Research Neighbourhood utilises unobtrusive colours and design 
features, while remaining readable and visible, utilising the Poppins font and a cool Arctic 
colour palette. The design principles emphasise simplicity, clarity, and a sense of 
spaciousness. 
Design Themes 
The current default theme is Arctic, characterised by cool green-blues and greys. 
Visual Components 
1.​ Main Dashboard 
○​ Features a clean, modular layout with adaptable panels. 
○​ Quick access to core functions through a top navigation bar and sidebar. 
○​ Visualisations appear as interactive widgets that can be resized and moved. 
2.​ Visualisation Panels 
○​ Dynamic graphs and data maps with smooth transitions and animated 
interactions. 
○​ Colour coding aligns with the chosen theme to maintain visual consistency. 
3.​ Input and Command Modules: 
○​ Clean, spacious text input fields with unobtrusive placeholder text. 
○​ Voice input buttons with clear audio indicators. 
○​ Touch and gesture prompts are displayed contextually. 
4.​ Notifications and Alerts 
○​ Subtle, non-intrusive alerts that fade out when no longer relevant. 
○​ Configurable settings allow users to determine the level of alert intensity and 
persistence. 
Cognitive Load Management 
Research Neighbourhood is designed to reduce cognitive load and enhance mental clarity 
through intentional arrangement, interface consistency, and fault-tolerant interactions. 
These design choices are grounded in principles from cognitive neuroscience and 
neurodesign, which highlight how attention, memory, and perception are shaped by the 
structure and presentation of information. The tool prioritises spatial coherence, pattern 
recognition, and emotional resonance to create an interface that feels both intuitive and 
28

## Page 29

informative. For specific references, see the Neuroscience-Informed UX Recommendations 
Table in the Appendix. 
Principles and Features 
●​ Progressive Disclosure: Showing essential information first and revealing more 
only when needed reduces the working memory burden. This aligns with the task 
segmentation principle noted in Designing with Neuroscience, which emphasises 
presenting steps only when users are cognitively prepared for them. 
●​ Contextual Cues: Subtle visual indicators (e.g., icons, highlighting) reduce ambiguity 
and direct user attention without clutter. This reflects neuroaesthetic insights from 
Neuroarchitecture and UX, where proximity and alignment help users interpret 
groups of items as meaningful units. 
●​ Fault Tolerance: 
○​ Undo and Redo: mechanisms mitigate anxiety by allowing safe exploration, 
decreasing the stakes of decision-making. 
○​ Version History: Provides a broader safety net by allowing users to review 
and restore previous states across sessions. This supports confidence in 
experimentation, reduces cognitive burden from having to track changes 
mentally, and reinforces memory through external scaffolding. 
○​ Contextual Warnings: Alerts before irreversible actions, with clear, 
non-technical explanations to support informed decision-making and 
prevent unintended consequences. 
●​ Adaptive Complexity: Users begin with minimal cognitive demands: complexity 
grows in tandem with their evolving cognitive model. This maintains cognitive 
proximity in evolving contexts through responsive, emergent interaction, as 
suggested by Cognitive Experience Design (CXD), rather than enforcing rigid 
onboarding sequences. 
●​ Spatial cues and Visual Noise: Avoid introducing spatial information and other 
visual elements that do not contribute to interacting with or understanding content 
and concepts, as it may increase cognitive load without adding value. 
●​ Familiar Patterns: Design elements follow recognisable conventions, capitalising on 
mental models shaped by prior experiences, as noted in Neurodesign. This minimises 
disorientation and supports intuitive learning. 
●​ Walkthrough Overlays: Interactive overlays provide contextual guidance for 
first-time users and complex tasks, reinforcing learning by breaking down actions 
into manageable steps. These walkthroughs align with the task segmentation 
principle from Designing with Neuroscience and support adaptive complexity by 
maintaining cognitive proximity—offering responsive assistance as users explore 
new features. They can be disabled or revisited on demand, ensuring autonomy 
while scaffolding deeper engagement. 
●​ Intentional Resistance: Designing for intentional resistance encourages more 
thoughtful and considered inquiry. This resistance is not impulsive, aggressive, 
dismissive, or neglectful. Rather, it is deliberate, emotionally informed, and guided

by care—producing a form of responsiveness that supports discernment and 
intentional action within the research process.

○​ LaTeX rendering support to maintain document formatting and structure 
including with equations and visualisations. 
3.​ Paper Compositor 
○​ NLP generates structured drafts from user’s input: topic, abstract, body 
sections (e.g. Methods), and optional data. 
○​ From there, the system: 
i.​
Identifies Research Context – Cross-references the knowledge graph 
and document library to determine the field, subfields, and related 
work. 
ii.​ Structures the Paper – Suggests logical sections based on established 
research patterns.

Technical Specifications 
The technical architecture of Research Neighbourhood is modular, scalable, and adaptable. 
The design philosophy prioritises usability, fault tolerance, and maintainability, leveraging 
modern technologies to deliver a responsive user experience. For a full review of the back 
end design see (Vladimir Baulin et al. 2025). See System Architecture for more detailed 
description. 
Challenges and Solutions 
Developing Research Neighbourhood involves addressing several technical and conceptual 
challenges. Below are some of the most significant challenges and the solutions proposed 
to overcome them. 
1. Data Format and Compatibility 
●​ Challenge: Research data is often stored in diverse formats such as PDFs, LaTeX 
documents, internet websites, and plain text files. Ensuring compatibility while 
maintaining document fidelity is crucial. 
●​ Solution: Utilising robust parsers and converters for common formats, with a 
modular backend that can be expanded to accommodate new file types as needed. 
By employing open-source libraries and maintaining a flexible import pipeline, the 
system remains adaptable. 
32

## Page 33

2. Real-Time Collaboration 
●​ Challenge: Supporting simultaneous editing and annotation without data loss or 
conflict. 
●​ Solution: Implementing real-time synchronisation through WebSocket protocols 
and version control. Maintaining a clear document history to allow rollback in case 
of conflicting edits. 
3. Visualisation and Graph Complexity 
●​ Challenge: Displaying a knowledge graph of interconnected concepts in a way that is 
comprehensible and not overwhelming, especially without relying on complex 
features like clustering or semantic zooming. 
●​ Solution: Initially, the system will generate a force-directed graph based on links 
between concepts, similar to a simplified Obsidian.md structure. Users will be able to 
interact with this fixed graph layout through basic navigation and flexible 
movement, enabling exploration without customisation. The emphasis is on 
providing a clear, interactive view of how concepts are connected, supporting the 
identification of knowledge gaps through spatial navigation rather than feature 
complexity. 
4. Data Security and Privacy 
●​ Challenge: Ensuring that sensitive research data is stored securely and shared only 
with intended collaborators, amidst heterogeneity and change in compliance 
environments. 
●​ Solution: Implementing secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and 
encrypted storage for sensitive data. Access controls and permissions management 
are embedded into the collaboration framework. 
5. Usability and Accessibility 
●​ Challenge: Balancing feature richness with intuitive and accessible interface design. 
●​ Solution: Conducting iterative usability testing with diverse user groups to refine 
interaction patterns. Incorporating accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) to ensure 
inclusivity. Offering multiple visual themes and layouts to accommodate different 
user preferences and contexts. 
 
33

Next Steps and Future Work 
To minimise cognitive load and streamline interaction, the design should prioritise 
familiarity and intuitive navigation. Instead of breaking information into overly 
fragmented steps, the system should leverage: 
●​ Familiar Structures & Analogies – Organise content in ways that mirror intuitive 
workflows (e.g. cooking recipes, project trees, conceptual maps), reducing the need 
for constant reorientation. 
●​ Comparative & Contextual Views – Provide side-by-side comparisons, overlays, and 
dynamically linked concepts to support contextualised reasoning and synthesis 
without mental overload. 
●​ Progressive Visual Navigation Enhancements – Introduce features such as 
clustering, semantic zooming, and filtering to support more advanced exploration of 
the knowledge graph. These enhancements will allow users to view different levels 
of abstraction and tailor their navigation as the graph grows in complexity and 
scale. 
●​ Iterative Refinement – Enable users to hypothesise, annotate, and refine ideas 
directly within the interface, building layered understanding over time. 
●​ Idea Generation and Evaluation - Recognise the connection between cognition, 
visual perception, and physical coordination in both divergent (non-normative, 
exploratory) and convergent (focused, evaluative) thinking. Gaze studies show how 
users visually scan for patterns and construct meaning, while 
coordination—typically involving the hands, but also alternative modalities for 
users with assistive technologies—supports the externalisation and refinement of 
ideas. [see Appendix citations 6, 8, 15]. 
●​ Predictive AI Support – Introduce agents with persistent memory that adapt to user 
preferences over time through conversation and co-learning. These agents can offer 
contextual suggestions, recall prior user intentions, and surface relevant 
materials—while backend safeguards ensure platform alignment and mitigate 
misuse. 
●​ Context-Aware and Responsive Interface Options – Provide subtle, situationally 
relevant cues—such as overlays, tooltips, or visual prompts—that respond to user 
activity and inferred intent. These adaptive elements, grounded in the principles of 
active inference and the perception-action model, help users navigate their 
environment by presenting options and opportunities based on their evolving needs 
and context. By aligning the interface with users’ predictive processing and ongoing 
interactions, the system provides an environment where users can explore different 
pathways without being constrained by a fixed or linear workflow. This approach 
enhances usability, offering more flexibility with decision-making affordances and 
minimal disruption. 
Conclusion 
34

## Page 35

Research Neighbourhood is a transformative collaboration tool, where insight grows 
within the research community. By reimagining the way research data is visualised and 
interconnected, it supports richer, more meaningful engagement with academic content. 
Its design is grounded in principles of cognitive load and visual noise reduction, 
collaborative knowledge building, and fault tolerance — creating an environment that 
adapts to the complex workflows of modern research. Through modularity and 
personalisation, Research Neighbourhood evolves alongside users’ needs, promoting 
efficiency and creativity in research practices. 
By addressing key challenges with thoughtful solutions, the platform positions itself as an 
essential companion to modern research — enabling users to build, explore, and share 
knowledge in dynamic and intuitive ways. This document provides us with transitional 
materials as we navigate from prototyping towards implementation. We are now seeking 
stakeholders: individual researchers, research groups, and communities, with special 
attention to trans- and interdisciplinary spaces. We aim to thrive in this space between the 
generalist and specialist, moving beyond bridge building into distributed knowledge 
networks. 
Getting to where we're going won’t be a matter of hitting fixed targets, but of moving with 
care and clarity in a shared direction. We see this as a journey marked by many waypoints: 
early collaborations, iterative design, hard-won insights, and unexpected detours. Along 
the way, we anticipate both friction and momentum—barriers that surface blind spots, and 
breakthroughs that realign our path. Our commitment is to stay oriented toward 
meaningful, collective discovery, while building the infrastructure that can carry us 
through rough terrain and across long distances. The route is not fully mapped, but the 
compass is clear: toward systems that make research more responsive, coherent, and alive.
